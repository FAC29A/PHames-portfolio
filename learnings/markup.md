## 1. Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility

The HTML structure of the website follows semantic HTML practices by using appropriate tags such as header, nav, main, section, and others to create a well-structured and accessible website.

## 2. Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers

The HTML includes alt attributes for images, ensuring that screen readers can provide text descriptions for non-text content, making the site more accessible. It also includes alt attributes for links, meaning screen readers can navigate the page with ease.

## 3. Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably

The website uses CSS root variables to define colours, making it easy to maintain consistent and accessible colour contrast. This ensures the colour combinations meet accessibility criteria, such as the use of var(--extra-light) for text on a dark background.

## 4. Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria

We utilised the A11y Project and screenreading software to ensure the site met accessibility criteria.

## 5. Use CSS media queries to ensure our content is always presented effectively on screens of different sizes

The CSS includes media queries to make the website responsive, ensuring that content is presented effectively on screens of various sizes. For example, media queries are used for different screen width breakpoints.

## 6. Demonstrate a mobile-first approach to building a website

The CSS includes styles that prioritise mobile devices by default, ensuring that the website is responsive and user-friendly on smaller screens, and progressively enhancing the layout for larger screens.

## 7. Use CSS variables to apply repeated colours to HTML elements

The use of CSS variables, like --extra-light-clear, --light, and --dark-clear, allows for consistent and easy colour management across the website, improving maintainability.

## 8. Use CSS Flexbox to style children in a single-direction layout (ie a row or a column)

The website utilizes CSS Flexbox to style child elements in a single-direction layout, such as the navigation menu and team member grid, ensuring a flexible and responsive design. An example of this can be seen in the navbar below.

## 9. Use CSS Grid to style children in two-direction layout

CSS Grid is used to create a grid layout for the team members, demonstrating the ability to style children in a two-direction layout, which enhances the visual design of the site.

## 10. Ensure our Git commit history tells a coherent story

This is an area we need to work on. The majority of git commits were clear, but not detailed enough.

## 11. Use the appropriate input types in HTML forms for gathering different types of information

The HTML includes appropriate input types for form elements, such as using type="text" for name fields, type="email" for email addresses, and type="radio" for multiple-choice options, ensuring accurate data gathering and user experience in forms.
